# Text Summarizer using Streamlit, OpenRouter, GPT, FAISS, audio playback and history search.
 **An AI-powered text & PDF summarization app with built-in audio playback and intelligent summary history using FAISS.**

## Overview
The **Smart Summarizer App** allows users to upload PDFs or directly input text and get concise, meaningful summaries generated by AI. It features a clean, dark-themed interface, inline **text-to-speech playback**, and a powerful **semantic history search** using FAISS vectors.

This project demonstrates the integration of NLP, speech synthesis, and UI design into one seamless Streamlit app.

## Key Features
### 1. Text & PDF Summarization
- Upload any **PDF file** or **paste text** directly.
- Extracts text using `pdfplumber` and summarizes using **OpenRouter AI (GPT-based model)**.
- Supports long text handling and provides downloadable summaries.
- Includes **token count estimation** for transparency.

### 2. Audio Summary Playback
- Listen to generated summaries instantly using **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**.
- Smooth inline player — no external download required.
- Audio saved as `.mp3` and auto-updated for each new summary.
- Includes **downloadable audio file** for offline use.

### 3. Smart History with FAISS Index
- Every generated summary is automatically stored in `/history/summaries.csv`.
- FAISS vector indexing allows **semantic similarity search** — find summaries related by meaning, not just words.
- “Clear History” option to delete all stored data instantly.
- History and search appear in a **dedicated sidebar page**.

### 4. Modern & Aesthetic Dark UI
- Custom-designed **dark gradient interface** (`#0E1117` / `#161A25` tones).
- Gradient buttons, glowing cards, hover effects, and rounded edges.
- Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile.
- Organized two-tab structure:
  - ** Summarize** — For PDF upload, text input, summarization, audio playback & downloads.
  - ** History & Search** — For viewing and searching stored summaries.

## Tech Stack
| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **Streamlit** | Web app UI framework |
| **pdfplumber** | PDF text extraction |
| **OpenRouter API (GPT)** | Summarization |
| **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** | Audio summary generation |

## Example Content
The app includes example data to demonstrate its features:
- **PDF samples** — uploaded short stories and articles for testing summarization.
- **Text examples** — short narrative or informative passages.
- **Word & Excel outputs** — exported summary records.
- **Audio examples** — `.mp3` files generated from summaries.
- **Screenshots** — show the summarizer UI, history page, and dark theme in action.

## Output Examples
-  **Summary (Text):**
  > “The story captures how persistence leads to success even amidst failures.”

-  **Audio Summary:**
  Plays immediately within the app.

-  **History Search:**
  Searching “motivation” brings up related summaries semantically, even if the word doesn’t appear.

## Data Persistence
- All summaries, vectorizer, and FAISS index files are saved locally.
- The app automatically rebuilds the index whenever a new summary is added.
- No data loss occurs between sessions.
